Introduction

Problem Statement

The world is currently facing a widespread and gradual crisis that threatens the foundation of Good Health and Well-being.
While significant strides have been made in addressing traditional health concerns such as infectious diseases and maternal mortality, a silent epidemic continues to escalate, posing a formidable threat to global well-being. Mental health, often relegated to the shadows of public health discussions, has emerged as a leading cause of death worldwide, challenging the core tenets of SDG3(Good Health and Well-Being)

Despite the progress made in extending life expectancy and reducing communicable diseases, the burden of mental health disorders is steadily on the rise. Mental health-related issues, encompassing conditions such as depression, anxiety, and suicide, have become a pervasive global challenge, affecting individuals across age groups, socio-economic backgrounds, and geographical locations. This burgeoning crisis is not only undermining individual health but also exerting a profound impact on the fabric of communities and societies at large.

Running

In the Appointment section there are two forms new appointment and been here before
For the new appointment form a user inputs their details and the window alerts that sesion has been booked,
this is recorded to our db.json by a POST method.
For the been here before form, a user can input the therapists name that has been their handler for the sessions.This form fullfils the GET request,we are reaching the and communicating with the server to access the therapist's name, if the name is in our database and then there is an alert fired to assure the patient that the session is confirmed.
